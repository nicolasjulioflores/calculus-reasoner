# calculus-reasoner

The examples we have derived so far are in src/Lib.hs (see `examples`).

To run the example reasoning:

1. At the command line enter the ghci: `stack ghci`
2. Enter the command `map (calculate claws) examples`.

To run on your own example, you will have to use our datastructure as parsing is not yet setup. 
`calculate claws <your_example>`, replacing the part in `<>`.
